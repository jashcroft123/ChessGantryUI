# ChessGantryUI
An attempt to make a chess playing robot. Using  C# WPF front end interactive with an NI MyRIO

## Introduction
I am a Automation Software Engineer (CLD), with a MEng in Mechanical Engineering with Mechatronics, currently working at Renishaw plc.

During my graduate scheme I was given a NI MyRIO to develop whatever I wanted. The idea being that I would learn how to program a realtime application using LabVIEW.

I chose to take this as an oppotunity use C# to develop a front end to interact with the realtime system I will develop [here](https://github.com/jashcroft123/ChessGantryRealTime).

This front end displays a 3D model of a chess board complete with piece. Starting with White a piece is selected and legal moves are shown. Upon selecting a legal square the move commands are sent to the realtime system to move the gantry and complete the move. Then it is blacks turn to move.
